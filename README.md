This is a project I built during the RocketU Developer Program located inside RocketSpace Accelerator San Francisco.  

This is an iPhone application I coded using AngularJS/Ionic Framework along with Cordova to create a native Iphone application.  I am also retrieving data from the Python/Django TastyPie REST API I built for my final project.  

Feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions!
